**Task**

Coding in function threeInOne. function accept 1 parameters arr, it's a 1D number array. Your task is to merge each of the 3 elements into 1 elements (sum value) and return the result.

Note1: You should not modify the original array.

Note2: Because this is a beginner Kata, and due to the author's mercy ;-), so you do not have to verify the validity of the parameter, and do not worry about the number of elements of the array is not a multiple of 3.

**Code**

```
  function threeInOne(arr) {
      let arrNew = arr.slice();
      let i = 0;  let arr1 = [];
      while (arrNew.length > 0) {
        arr1[i] = arrNew.splice(0,3).reduce((prev, el) => {
          return prev + el
        }, 0);
        i++;
      }   return arr1;
    }
    console.log (threeInOne( [1,3,5,2,4,6,7,7,7]));
